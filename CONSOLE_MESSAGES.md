# Console Messages Explained

## Normal Operation Messages

When the extension loads successfully, you will see these messages in the console:

### ✅ Success Messages (From our extension)

```
TensorFlow.js backend initialized: webgl
Pose detector created successfully
```

These messages indicate that the extension is working correctly!

### ⚠️ YouTube Platform Warnings (Not from our extension)

The following warnings are generated by YouTube itself and can be safely ignored:

#### 1. LegacyDataMixin Warning
```
LegacyDataMixin will be applied to all legacy elements.
Set `_legacyUndefinedCheck: true` on element class to enable.
```
**Source:** YouTube's Polymer framework
**Impact:** None on our extension
**Action:** Ignore

#### 2. About:blank Script Blocked
```
Blocked script execution in 'about:blank' because the document's frame is sandboxed
and the 'allow-scripts' permission is not set.
```
**Source:** YouTube's internal iframe sandboxing
**Impact:** None on our extension
**Action:** Ignore

#### 3. PWA Banner Warning
```
Banner not shown: beforeinstallpromptevent.preventDefault() called.
The page must call beforeinstallpromptevent.prompt() to show the banner.
```
**Source:** YouTube's Progressive Web App (PWA) installation prompt
**Impact:** None on our extension
**Action:** Ignore

#### 4. Storage Access Permission Denied
```
requestStorageAccessFor: Permission denied.
```
**Source:** YouTube attempting to access cross-site storage
**Impact:** Browser security feature blocking YouTube's request
**Action:** Ignore (appears multiple times, all from YouTube)

## Extension-Specific Messages

### During Normal Operation

```
Popup already exists, skipping creation
```
**Meaning:** The popup was already created (happens during page navigation)
**Action:** Normal behavior, no action needed

### If Clicked Too Early

```
Popup element not found. Please wait for video to load.
```
**Meaning:** Extension icon was clicked before video fully loaded
**Action:** Wait a moment and try again

### Debug Messages

```
Pose estimation error: [error details]
```
**Meaning:** Pose detection encountered an issue
**Possible causes:**
- No person visible in the video
- Poor video quality
- Video is paused

## Troubleshooting

### If you DON'T see these success messages:
```
TensorFlow.js backend initialized: webgl
Pose detector created successfully
```

**Then try:**
1. Reload the extension at chrome://extensions/
2. Refresh the YouTube page (F5)
3. Check if WebGL is enabled in your browser
4. Clear browser cache

### If pose detection doesn't work:

1. Make sure the video is playing (not paused)
2. Ensure there's a person visible in the video
3. Click the extension icon to check if animations are enabled (green button)
4. Try a different video with clear person visibility

## Performance Notes

The extension uses WebGL for GPU acceleration. Performance will vary based on:
- Your GPU capabilities
- Video resolution
- Selected animation complexity (particles are more demanding than skeleton)

For best performance:
- Use simpler animations (skeleton)
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date
