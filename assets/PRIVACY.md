## 2. How the Extension Works

This extension adds Halloween animation effects to YouTube videos. It uses AI-powered real-time pose detection to recognize body movements in videos and overlay animations (e.g., glowing skeletons, pumpkin heads, bats, ghosts) based on those movements.

**Important:** All video analysis and pose detection is performed entirely locally in your browser. No video data, images, or analysis results are transmitted to external servers.

---

## 3. What Data Is Processed?

### 3.1 Local Storage (chrome.storage)

The extension uses the Chrome Storage API to store your settings and preferences locally. This includes:

- Selected animation effects
- Activation/deactivation status of the extension
- Custom settings (e.g., animation intensity)

*This data remains exclusively on your device and is not transmitted to me or third parties.*

### 3.2 Local Video Analysis

For pose detection, video frames of the currently playing YouTube video are analyzed. This processing:

- Takes place entirely locally in your browser
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Does not permanently store any video frames or analysis results
- Only runs when the extension is active

### 3.3 No Collection of Personal Data

The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. In particular, the following are **not** collected:

- IP addresses or device identifiers
- Your YouTube account or login credentials
- Your browsing history or search behavior
- The videos you watch
- Location data

## 4. Browser Permissions Used

The extension requires the following permissions to function:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Allows access to the active tab to insert animations into the YouTube video. |
| `tabs` | Required to detect whether the current tab is a YouTube page. |
| `webNavigation` | Enables the extension to activate correctly during page transitions within YouTube (e.g., when switching between videos). |
| `storage` | Stores your settings locally on your device (no cloud synchronization). |
| `host_permissions` (youtube.com) | Restricts the extension exclusively to YouTube. The extension has no access to other websites. |

## 5. Data Sharing with Third Parties

**No data is shared with third parties.**

Since this extension does not send any data to external servers, there is no sharing with third parties such as analytics tools, advertising partners, or cloud services.

*Note regarding the browser:* The operation of Google Chrome and your operating system may collect data by default (e.g., crash reports) over which I have no control. These are subject to Google's privacy policies.

## 7. Your Rights

Since this extension does not process any personal data, data protection rights (such as access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection pursuant to Art. 15–21 GDPR) cannot practically be exercised — there is simply no data to which these rights could apply.

**Deleting your local data:** You can delete the settings stored by the extension at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing your browser data.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at any time using the email address provided above.
